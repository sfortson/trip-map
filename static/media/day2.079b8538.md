# Maam Valley

## Overview

This is Mam Ean (often anglicised as Maumeen; meaning 'The Pass of the Birds'), a little pilgrimage spot where Mass is held three times every year. Here you'll find the tiny chapel, a mass altar and the Stations of the Cross scattered around the rocky, boggy site. There is also 'Leaba Phairic' (Patrick's bed), a rock recess associated with St. Patrick and a little before the chapel, you will have passed a holy well called Tobar Phadraig (Patrick's Well), on the left side of the path.

There are indications that this location was originally used for the Celtic harvest festival of Lughnasa and only later incorporated into the Christian tradition. This is quite common in Ireland where there are hundreds of holy wells and sacred trees that used to be worshipped since pagan times. Tobar Phadraig is reputed to have the power to cure sick cattle and the pass was once used to drive cows and sheep over the mountains.
