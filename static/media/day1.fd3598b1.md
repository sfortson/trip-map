# Oughterard

## Overview
Oughterard (meaning 'upper height') is a small town on the banks of the Owenriff River in County Galway. It is beside Lough Corrib, the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland, and at the start of the Connermara Mountain Range. The Victorian writer William Makepeace Thackeray wrote of Oughterard: 'A more beautiful village can scarcely be seen'. Today it is still quite pretty and makes for a good gateway to Connemara. It also is one of Ireland's principal angling centres.
